As a teaching assistant for my advisor's class on chemical kinetics and reactor
design, I was asked to prepare material for a first-week review session
reminding students of concepts from linear algebra. What originally began
as a collection of hand-written notes developed over three instances of
the course into a full set of slides, then a second set with additional
content, including some material on ordinary differential equations. I have
combined and slightly reorganized the two presentations into a single file.
