In the Spring 2021 semester, I took a topics course on uncertainty
quantification. As part of the class schedule, each student delivered two
presentations describing a subject of interest within the scope of the
syllabus. I chose to focus on Gaussian processes and their applicability to
Bayesian optimization. I have since combined the content into a single set
of slides, reorganized the structure, and added some additional content.
The original presentation slides are included in a subdirectory as well.
